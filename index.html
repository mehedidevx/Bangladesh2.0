            "Dr. Mohammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker,
            economist, and civil society leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace
            Prize for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of
            microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs
            too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. Yunus and the
            Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. The
            microcredit model has been replicated in many countries around the
            world, helping millions of people to escape poverty and improve
            their lives."
